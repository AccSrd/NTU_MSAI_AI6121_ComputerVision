**[AI6121] Computer Vision** is an elective course of Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence Graduate Programme **(MSAI)**, School of Computer Science and Engineering **(SCSE)**, Nanyang Technological University **(NTU)**, Singapore. The repository corresponds to the AI6121 of **Semester 1, AY2021-2022**, starting from 08/2021. **The instructor of this course is Prof. Lu Shijian.**

The projects of this course consist of **two individual Assignments**, **one individual Literature Review**, and **one group Project**. The topic and score of the assignment are shown below. Since multiple people complete the group work, I do not have the right to disclose the report, others' codes, and grades individually so that the relevant parts will be hidden, and the group project only presents part of the code and report finished by myself.

In addition, the generated output image is not given in the file in order to save space since all the source code has been provided. Data are uploaded after all output folders are emptied.

Type | Topic | Grade
------------ | ------------- | ---
Assignment 1 | Histogram Equalization | 20.0 / 20.0
Assignment 2 | Disparity Map | 18.5 / 20.0
Literature Review | Self-supervised Image Denoise | 20.0 / 20.0
Group Project | Neural Network | N.A. / 40.0
